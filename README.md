I've created this project based on this reddit [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/d1s3lj/rformula1_active_user_count_during_the_italian/)  
This project logs the active users once every minute using the reddit api at [https://reddit.com/r/formula1/about.json](https://reddit.com/r/formula1/about.json)

Enjoy!
